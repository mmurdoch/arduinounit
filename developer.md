ArduinoUnit -- Developer Guide
==============================

How to build, test, and extend ArduinoUnit 2.0.
(see the readme on how to *use* ArduinoUnit 2.0).

###Version 2.0

##Layout

Here are the basic files and folders

* `readme.md` --- general user's guide
* `porting-guide.md` --- porting from 1.0 to 2.0
* `developer.md` --- starting guide for someone extending ArduinoUnit.
* `src` --- content of ArduinoUnit that should be copied to the user or
          system-wide arduino libraries folder.
* `firmware` --- the firmware to test the functionality of the
          the library (tested on mega2560).
* `tests` --- various tests, the output from these tests, and the result
            of comparing these against known results.
* `bin` --- helper files & scripts.

##Setup

* Install python 2.7
  
  - Windows: try ActiveState python (reboot).
  - OS X: already installed.
  - Linux: already installed.

  Typing `python -v` at the command prompt should give version information
  about python.

* Install Arduino IDE

  - Windows: If you have version 1.03, I suggest you copy the Zip file to
    C:\Arduino103

  - OSX Drag App to /Applications folder

  - Linux sudo apt-get install arduino, or sudo yum install arduino, or
    check your distribution advice.

  Make sure you can start the IDE and download Blink to your dev board,
  and note which serial port you use to communicate with the board.

* Install Git

  - Windows: Install the git-bash tool.

  - OS X Install XCode and choose to install command line tools.

  - Linux `sudo apt-get install git` or `sudo yum install git-core`

  From here on, I will assume you are working from the git-bash
  shell in windows, or a bash command prompt.

* Istall pyserial 2.6 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial)

  Download tar.gz file and type:
  <pre>
      tar zxf pyserial-2.6.tar.gz
      cd pyserial-2.6
      sudo python setup.py install
  </pre>

* On unix (osx/linux) install pexpect 2.3 (http://www.noah.org/wiki/Pexpect#topip.py)

  Download tar.gz file and type:
  <pre>
      tar zxf pexpect-2.3.tar.gz
      cd pexpect-2.3
      sudo python setup.py install
  </pre>

* On windows install winpexpect (https://bitbucket.org/geertj/winpexpect/downloads)

  Download tar.gz file and type:
  <pre>
      tar zxf geertj-winpexpect*.tar.gz
      cd geertj-winpexpect*
      sudo python setup.py install
  </pre>

* Install Scons (scons.org).

  The MSI failed for me in windows.  Get the tar file and install as 
  pyserial above.

* Copy `firmware/arscons.json.{win,osx,linux}` to `firmware/arscons.json`
  and edit for local settings

  A leading tile (~) in ARDUINO_HOME, AVR_HOME, and SKETCHBOOK_HOME is
  replaced by the user's home directory.

* Build, upload, and monitor the test code in the project root folder

  <pre>
    ./bin/build 
    ./bin/build upload
    ./bin/build monitor
  </pre>

* Run the testing firmware

  The firmware is interactive, so you can change test configurations
  before running the test suite.  You can run the arduino serial monitor
  at 9600 baud and line endings set to either 'Newline' or 'Both NL & CR'
  to see the output.  For example:
  <pre>
      command> run
      ...
      test overall passed.
      test summary: 6 passed, 1 failed, and 1 skipped, out of 8 test(s).
  </pre>
  or
  <pre>
      command> exclude *
      command> include assert*
      command> min_verbosity 00111111
      command> run
      ...
  </pre>
  You can use the prompted commands to change the test set and the verbosity
  of the tests.

  You can automatically run a set of tests using 
  <pre>
    ./bin/test tests/*.in
  </pre>
